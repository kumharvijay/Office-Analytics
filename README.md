# OFFICE ANALYTICS

## Purpose of Project
  The purpose of this project is to gain insights into the working preferences of employees 
	and to optimize workplace strategies accordingly.

### Percentage of Work-From-Home Employees
#### Insightful Planning:
>    Understanding employee presence allows for effective planning of team-building activities
     and team lunches when all employees are in the office.
#### Hybrid Optimization:
>    Adopting a hybrid work model offers benefits such as improved capacity and seating planning.
     With employees working remotely for two days and being present for three, it facilitates better
     resource allocation, like providing laptops to all.
#### Space Utilization:
>    Embracing a hybrid model also enables better utilization of office space. This means reduced
     rental expenses and optimized infrastructure costs, leading to overall savings.
#### Benefits:
>    The organization stands to benefit from both tangible cost savings and intangible gains
     in employee satisfaction and collaboration.
  
### Insightful Sick Leave Analysis:
>   By examining sick leave trends, we gain valuable insights into employee health and well-being.
#### Identification of Issues:
>   If a significant number, let's say more than 10 people, are simultaneously taking sick leave,
    it signals a potential issue within the workplace.
#### Targeted Interventions:
>   Identifying patterns of illness allows for targeted interventions and improved office sensitization
    towards specific diseases or health concerns.
#### Promoting Healthier Work Environment:
>   Implementing special measures and health initiatives based on these insights promotes a healthier and
    more supportive work environment.

### Steps of Data Analysis

#### Gathering and Transforming Data:
>  Collecting relevant data related to employee work preferences and sick leave.
#### Cleaning and Arranging Data:
>  Organizing the data in a single table format, categorized month-wise.
#### Creating Matrices:
>  Utilizing DAX in Power BI to create matrices for comprehensive analysis.
#### Insightful Dashboard Creation:
>  Developing an insightful dashboard in Power BI to visualize the analyzed data effectively.
